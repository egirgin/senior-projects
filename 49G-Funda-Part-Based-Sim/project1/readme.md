# CmpE 49G : Project1 : Buffon's Needle

## Emre Girgin - 2016400099

### Running: 
This is a Matlab implementation. After you set the parameters you can run it in Matlab.

### Parameters:

```Matlab
    needle_size = 1;
    line_distance = 100;
```
- Needle size is what it is. 
- Line distance is distance between equally separated lines but as it is mentioned in the report, simulation is run between 0 and line_distance/2 period but it is handled in code, so you can type it in original way.

### Output
There will be a figure with 5 subplots for number of needles from 10^2 to 10^6.
